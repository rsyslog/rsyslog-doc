`AddtlFrameDelimiter`, module, imtcp, integer, `-1`, no, `$InputTCPServerAddtlFrameDelimiter`, 4.3.1, , This directive permits to specify an additional frame delimiter for Multiple receivers may be configured by specifying `$InputTCPServerRun` multiple times.
`Allowed_Error_Codes`, action, ommongodb
`allow_regex`, module, mmnormalize, boolean, `off`, no, , 6.1.2, , Specifies if regex field-type should be allowed. Regex field-type has significantly higher computational overhead compared to other fields, so it should be avoided when another field-type can achieve the desired effect. Needs to be "on" for regex field-type to work.
`allowUnsignedCerts`, action, omclickhouse, binary, `on`, no, , , , The module accepts connections to servers, which have unsigned certificates. If this parameter is disabled, the module will verify whether the certificates are authentic.
`allowunsignedcerts`, action, omelasticsearch, boolean, `off`, no, , , , If "`on`", this will set the curl `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` option to `0`. You are strongly discouraged to set this to "`on`". It is primarily useful only for debugging or testing.

`allowunsignedcerts`, module, mmkubernetes, boolean, `off`, no, , , , If "on", this will set the curl `CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER` option to 0. You are strongly discouraged to set this to "`on`". It is primarily useful only for debugging or testing.
`amqp_address`, action, omazureeventhubs, integer, `2000`, no, , 8.2304, , "The configuration property for the AMQP address used to connect to Microsoft Azure Event Hubs is typically referred to as the 'Event Hubs connection string'. It specifies the URL that is used to connect to the target Event Hubs instance in Microsoft Azure. If the `amqp_address` is configured, the configuration parameters for `azurehost`, `azureport`, `azure_key_name` and `azure_key` will be ignored.  A sample Event Hubs connection string URL is: `amqps://[Shared access key name]:[Shared access key]@[Event Hubs namespace].servicebus.windows.net/[Event Hubs Instance]`"

In that case, double buffers will be used so that one buffer can be filled while the other buffer is being written. Note that in order to enable `FlushInterval`, AsyncWriting must be set to "`on`". Otherwise, the flush interval will be ignored.
`azurehost`, action, omazureeventhubs, word, , yes, , 8.2304, , Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the Event Hubs instance that the rsyslog output plugin should connect to. The format of the hostname should be `<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net`, where `<namespace>` is the name of the Event Hubs namespace that was created in Microsoft Azure. 
`azure_key`, action, omazureeventhubs, word, , yes, , 8.2304, , The configuration property for the Azure key used to connect to Microsoft Azure Event Hubs is typically referred to as the “Event Hubs shared access key”.

`azure_key_name`, action, omazureeventhubs, word, , yes, , 8.2304, , The configuration property for the Azure key name used to connect to Microsoft Azure Event Hubs is typically referred to as the “Event Hubs shared access key name”. It specifies the name of the shared access key that is used to authenticate and authorize connections to the Event Hubs instance. The shared access key is a secret string that is used to securely sign and validate requests to the Event Hubs instance.
`azureport`, action, omazureeventhubs, word, `5671`, no, , 8.2304, , Specifies the TCP port number used by the Event Hubs instance for incoming connections. The default port number for Event Hubs is `5671` for connections over the AMQP Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol. This property is usually optional in the configuration file of the rsyslog output plugin, as the default value of `5671` is typically used.
`basicAuthFile`, input, imhttp, string, , no, , , , Configures a `htpasswd` file and enables basic authentication on http request received on this input. If this option is not set, basic authentation will not be enabled.

`BatchSize`, module, imudp, integer, `32`, no, , , , This parameter is only meaningful if the system support recvmmsg() (newer Linux OSs do this). The parameter is silently ignored if the system does not support it. If supported, it sets the maximum number of UDP messages that can be obtained with a single OS call. For systems with high UDP traffic, a relatively high batch size can reduce system overhead and improve performance. However, this parameter should not be overdone. For each buffer, max message size bytes are statically required. Also, a too-high number leads to reduced efficiency, as some structures need to be completely initialized before the OS call is done.
`beginTransactionMark`, action, omprog
`Binary`, action, improg, string, `<external program> [<cmd arguments>]`, yes, , , , Command line : external program and arguments
`binary`, action, mmexternal, string, , yes, , 8.3.0, , The name of the external message modification plugin to be called. This can be a full path name.

`Broker`, action, omkafka
`buffer_size`, input, impcap, number (octets), `15740640`, no, , , , Set a buffer size in bytes to the capture handle. This parameter is only relevant when `no_buffer` is not active, and should be set depending on input packet rates, `buffer_timeout` and `packet_count` values.
`buffer_timeout`, input, impcap, number (ms), `10`, no, , , , Set a timeout in milliseconds between two system calls to get bufferized packets. This parameter prevents low input rate interfaces to keep packets in buffers for too long, but does not guarantee fetch every X seconds.
`bulkid`, action, omelasticsearch, word, , no, , , ,  This is the unique id to assign to the record. The bulk part is misleading - this can be used in both bulk mode `bulkmode` or in index (record at a time) mode. 
`bulkmode`, action, omclickhouse, binary, `on`, no, , , , The "`off`" setting means logs are shipped one by one. Each in its own HTTP request. The default "`on`" will send multiple logs in the same request. This is recommended, because it is many times faster than when bulkmode is turned off. The maximum number of logs sent in a single bulk request depends on your maxbytes and queue settings - usually limited by the dequeue batch size. 
`bulkmode`, action, omelasticsearch, binary, `off`, no, , , , The default "`off`" setting means logs are shipped one by one. Each in its own HTTP request, using the Index API. Set it to "`on`" and it will use Elasticsearch's Bulk API to send multiple logs in the same request.

`cacheexpireinterval`, module, mmkubernetes, integer, `-1`, no, , , , This parameter allows you to expire entries from the metadata cache. The values are -1: (default) - disables metadata cache expiration; 0: check cache for expired entries before every cache lookup; 1 or higher: the number is a number of seconds - check the cache for expired entries every this many seconds, when processing an entry
`checkpath`, action, omhttp
`closeTimeout`, action, improg, number, `200`, no, , , , Specifies whether a `KILL` signal must be sent to the external program in case it does not terminate within the timeout indicated by closeTimeout (when either the worker thread has been unscheduled, a restart of the program is being forced, or rsyslog is about to shutdown).
`closeTimeout`, action, omazureeventhubs, integer, `2000`, no, , 8.2304, , "The close timeout configuration property is used in the rsyslog output module to specify the amount of time the output module should wait for a response from Microsoft Azure Event Hubs before timing out and closing the connection.  This property is used to control the amount of time the output module will wait for a response from the target Event Hubs instance before giving up and assuming that the connection has failed. The close timeout property is specified in milliseconds.

Originally, only zlib was supported and still is the default. Since 8.2208.0 zstd is also supported. It provides much better compression ratios and performance, especially with multiple zstd worker threads enabled.  Possible values are: `zlib` and `zstd`
`Compression.mode`, input, imptcp, word, , no, , , , This is the counterpart to the compression modes set in omfwd `<omfwd>`. Please see it's documentation for details.
`compression.zstd.workers`, module, omfile, positive integer, , no, , 8.2208.0, , In zstd mode, this enables to configure zstd-internal compression worker threads. This setting has nothing to do with rsyslog workers.

`container`, action, omazureeventhubs, word, , yes, , 8.2304, , The configuration property for the Azure container used to connect to Microsoft Azure Event Hubs is typically referred to as the “Event Hubs Instance”. It specifies the name of the Event Hubs Instance, to which log data should be sent.
`container`, module, mmdblookup, word, `!iplocation`, no, , 8.28, , Specifies the container to be used to store the fields amended by mmdblookup.
`containerrulebase`, module, mmkubernetes, word, `/etc/rsyslog.d/k8s_container_name.rulebase`, no, , , , When processing json-file logs, this is the rulebase used to match the `CONTAINER_NAME` property value and extract metadata. For the actual rules, see containerrules.
`containerrules`, module, mmkubernetes, word, `*`, no, , , , For journald logs, there must be a message property `CONTAINER_NAME` which has a value matching these rules specified by this parameter. The default value is: `rule=:%k8s_prefix:char-to:_%_%container_name:char-to:.%.%container_hash:char-to:_%_%pod_name:char-to:_%_%namespace_name:char-to:_%_%not_used_1:char-to:_%_%not_used_2:rest%rule=:%k8s_prefix:char-to:_%_%container_name:char-to:_%_%pod_name:char-to:_%_%namespace_name:char-to:_%_%not_used_1:char-to:_%_%not_used_2:rest%`

`DefaultSeverity`, module, imjournal
`defaultTag`, module, imjournal, binary, `off`, no, , 8.2312.0, , The DefaultTag option specifies the default value for the tag field. In imjournal, this can happen when one of the following is missing: identifier string provided by the application (`SYSLOG_IDENTIFIER`) or name of the process the journal entry originates from (`_COMM`)
`DefaultTemplate`, action, omuxsock
`Defaulttz`, input, imptcp, string, , no, , , , Set default time zone. At most seven chars are set, as we would otherwise overrun our buffer.

`Delete`, action, imbatchreport, string, `<regex><reject>`, no, , , , This parameter informs the module to delete the report to flag it as treated. If the file is too large (or failed to be removed) it is renamed using the `<regex>` to identify part of the file name that has to be replaced it by `<reject>`.
`deleteStateOnFileDelete`, input, imfile, binary, `on`, no, , , , This parameter controls if state files are deleted if their associated main file is deleted. Usually, this is a good idea, because otherwise problems would occur if a new file with the same name is created. 
`delivery_mode`, action, omrabbitmq
`Device`, input, imudp, string, , no, , , , Bind socket to given device (e.g., `eth0`).  For Linux with VRF support, the Device option can be used to specify the VRF for the Address.
`dirCreateMode`, action, omfile, file mode, , no, `$DirCreateMode`, , , This is the same as FileCreateMode, but for directories automatically generated.
`DirCreateMode`, module, omfile, file mode, `O0700`, no, `$DirCreateMode`, , , Sets the default dirCreateMode to be used for an action if no explicit one is specified.

`DisableLFDelimiter`, input, imtcp, binary, `<module parameter>`, no, , 8.2106.0, , This permits to override the equally-named module parameter on the `input()` level. For further details, see the module parameter. 
`DisableLFDelimiter`, module, imtcp, binary, `off`, no, , , , Industry-standard plain text tcp syslog uses the LF to delimit syslog frames. However, some users brought up the case that it may be useful to define a different delimiter and totally disable LF as a delimiter (the use case named were multi-line messages). This mode is non-standard and will probably come with a lot of problems. 
`DisableSASL`, action, omamqp1, integer, `0`, no, , 8.17.0, , Setting this to a non-zero value will disable SASL negotiation. Only necessary if the message bus does not offer SASL support.
`DiscardTruncatedMsg`, input, imtcp, binary, `<module parameter>`, no, , 8.2106.0, , This permits to override the equally-named module parameter on the `input()` level. For further details, see the module parameter.
`DiscardTruncatedMsg`, module, imptcp, binary, `off`, no, , , , When a message is split because it is to long the second part is normally processed as the next message. This can cause Problems. When this parameter is turned on the part of the message after the truncation will be discarded.
`DiscardTruncatedMsg`, module, imtcp, binary, `off`, no, , , , When a message is split because it is to long the second part is normally processed as the next message. This can cause Problems. When this parameter is turned on the part of the message after the truncation will be discarded.
`discardTruncateMsg`, input, imfile, binary, `off`, no, , , ,  When messages are too long they are truncated and the following part is processed as a new message. When this parameter is turned on the truncated part is not processed but discarded.
`DockerApiUnixSockAddr`, module, imdocker, string, `/var/run/docker.sock`, no, , 8.41.0, , Specifies the Docker unix socket address to use.
`documentroot`, module, imhttp, string, `.`, no, , , , Configures `document_root` in the civetweb library. This option may also be configured using liboptions, however this option will take precedence.

`dstmetadatapath`, module, mmkubernetes, word, `$!`, no, , , , This is the where the kubernetes and docker properties will be written. By default, the module will add `$!kubernetes` and `$!docker`.
`dynafile`, action, omfile, string, , no, , , , For each message, the file name is generated based on the given template. Then, this file is opened. As with the file property, data is appended if the file already exists. If the file does not exist, a new file is created.
`dynaFileCacheSize`, action, omfile, integer, `10`, no, `$DynaFileCacheSize`, , , This parameter specifies the maximum size of the cache for dynamically-generated file names (dynafile= parmeter). This setting specifies how many open file handles should be cached. 
`dynafile.donotsuspend`, module, omfile, binary, `on`, no, , , , This permits SUSPENDing dynafile actions. Traditionally, SUSPEND mode was never entered for dynafiles as it would have blocked overall processing flow. Default is not to suspend (and thus block).
`DynaKey`, action, omhiredis
`DynaKey`, action, omkafka
`DynaTopic`, action, omkafka
`DynaTopic.cachesize`, action, omkafka
`dynbulkid`, action, omelasticsearch, binary, `off`, no, , , , If this parameter is set to "`on`", then the bulkid parameter `omelasticsearch-bulkid` specifies a template to use to generate the unique id value to assign to the record.
`dynParent`, action, omelasticsearch, binary, `off`, no, , , , Using the same parent for all the logs sent in the same action is quite unlikely. So you'd probably want to turn this "on" and specify a rsyslog template that will provide meaningful parent IDs for your logs.
`dynPipelineName`, action, omelasticsearch, binary, `off`, no, , , , Like dynSearchIndex, it allows you to specify a rsyslog template for pipelineName, instead of a static string.
`dynrestpath`, action, omhttp
`dynSearchIndex`, action, omelasticsearch, binary, `off`, no, , , , Whether the string provided for searchIndex should be taken as a rsyslog template. Defaults to "`off`", which means the index name will be taken literally. 
`dynSearchType`, action, omelasticsearch, binary, `off`, no, , , , Like dynSearchIndex, it allows you to specify a rsyslog template for searchType, instead of a static string.
`embeddedipv4.anonmode`, action, mmanon, word, `zero`, no, , 7.3.7, , This defines the mode, in which IPv6 addresses will be anonymized. There exist the `random`, `random-consistent`, and `zero` option modes.
`embeddedipv4.bits`, action, mmanon, positive integer, `96`, no, , 7.3.7, , This sets the number of bits that should be anonymized (bits are from the right, so lower bits are anonymized first). This setting permits to save network information while still anonymizing user-specific data.
`embeddedipv4.enable`, action, mmanon, binary, `on`, no, , 7.3.7, , Allows to enable or disable the anonymization of IPv6 addresses with embedded IPv4.
`endmsg.regex`, input, imfile, string, , no, , 8.38.0, , This permits the processing of multi-line messages. When set, a message is terminated when `endmsg.regex` matches the line that identifies the end of a message.
`Endpoint`, input, imhttp, string, , yes, , , , Sets a request path for an http input. Path should always start with a '`/`'.
`EnsureLFEnding`, action, omstdout
`EnterpriseOID`, action, omsnmp
`errorFile`, action, omclickhouse, word, , no, , , , If specified, records failed in bulk mode are written to this file, including their error cause. Rsyslog itself does not process the file any more, but the idea behind that mechanism is that the user can create a script to periodically inspect the error file and react appropriately. As the complete request is included, it is possible to simply resubmit messages from that script.
`errorFile`, action, omelasticsearch, word, , no, , , , If specified, records failed in bulk mode are written to this file, including their error cause. Rsyslog itself does not process the file any more, but the idea behind that mechanism is that the user can create a script to periodically inspect the error file and react appropriately.
`errorfile`, action, omhttp
`errorFile`, action, omkafka
`escapeLF`, input, imdocker, binary, `on`, no, , 8.41.0, , This is only meaningful if multi-line messages are to be processed. LF characters embedded into syslog messages cause a lot of trouble, as most tools and even the legacy syslog TCP protocol do not expect these.
`escapeLF`, input, imfile, binary, `1`, no, , 8.2001.0, , This is only meaningful if multi-line messages are to be processed. LF characters embedded into syslog messages cause a lot of trouble, as most tools and even the legacy syslog TCP protocol do not expect these.

`escapeLF.replacement`, input, imfile, string, depending on use, no, , 8.2001.0, , This parameter works in conjunction with `escapeLF`. It is only honored if `escapeLF="on"`.  It permits to replace the default escape sequence by a different character sequence. 
`esVersion.major`, action, omelasticsearch, integer, `0`, no, , 8.2402.0, , ElasticSearch is notoriously bad at maintaining backwards compatibility. For this reason, the setting can be used to configure the server's major version number (e.g. 7, 8, ...). As far as we know breaking changes only happen with major version changes. As of now, only value 8 triggers API changes. All other values select pre-version-8 API usage.
`eventproperties`, action, omazureeventhubs, array, , no, , 8.2301.0, , The eventproperties configuration property is an array property used to add key-value pairs as additional properties to the encoded AMQP message object, providing additional information about the log event.

`failOnChOwnFailure`, input, omfile, binary, on, `no`, `$FailOnChOwnFailure`, , , This option modifies behaviour of file creation. If different owners or groups are specified for new files or directories and rsyslogd fails to set these new owners or groups, it will log an error and NOT write to the file in question if that option is set to "on". If it is set to "off", the error will be ignored and processing continues. Keep in mind, that the files in this case may be (in)accessible by people who should not have permission. The default is "on".
`fields`, input, imhiredis, array, `[]`, no, , , , When using `imhiredis_stream_mode`, the module won't get a simple entry but will instead get hashes, with field/value pairs.

`FlowControl`, module, imtcp, binary, `on`, no, `$InputTCPFlowControl`, , , This setting specifies whether some message flow control shall be exercised on the related TCP input. If set to on, messages are handled as "light delayable", which means the sender is throttled a bit when the queue becomes near-full. This is done in order to preserve some queue space for inputs that can not throttle (like UDP), but it may have some undesired effect in some configurations. Still, we consider this as a useful setting and thus it is the default. To turn the handling off, simply configure that explicitly.
`flushInterval`, action, omfile, integer, `1`, no, `$OMFileFlushInterval`, , , Defines, in seconds, the interval after which unwritten data is flushed.
`flushOnTXEnd`, action, omfile, binary, `on`, no, `$OMFileFlushOnTXEnd`, , , Omfile has the capability to write output using a buffered writer. Disk writes are only done when the buffer is full. So if an error happens during that write, data is potentially lost.

You can specify a regular expression that characterizes the header to expect at the start of the next message. As such, it indicates the end of the current message. For example, one can use this setting to use a RFC3164 header as frame delimiter: `framing.delimiter.regex="^<[0-9]{1,3}>(Jan|Feb|Mar|Apr|May|Jun|Jul|Aug|Sep|Oct|Nov|Dec)"`
`Framingfix.cisco.asa`, input, imptcp, `binary`, off, no, , , , Cisco very occasionally sends a space after a line feed, which thrashes framing if not taken special care of. When this parameter is set to `on`, we permit space in front of the next frame and ignore it.

`Name`, input, imtcp, string, `imtcp`, no, `$InputTCPServerInputName`, , , Sets a name for the inputname property. If no name is set "`imtcp`" is used by default. Setting a name is not strictly necessary, but can be useful to apply filtering based on which input the message was received from.
`Name`, input, imudp, word, `imudp`, no , 8.3.3, , Specifies the value of the inputname property. In older versions, this was always "imudp" for all listeners, which still is the default. Starting with 7.3.9 it can be set to different values for each listener. Note that when a single input statement defines multiple listener ports, the inputname will be the same for all of them. If you want to differentiate in that case, use "name.appendPort" to make them unique.

`Threads`, module, imudp, integer, 1, no, , 7.5.5, , Number of worker threads to process incoming messages. These threads are utilized to pull data off the network. On a busy system, additional threads (but not more than there are CPUs/Cores) can help improving performance and avoiding message loss. Note that with too many threads, performance can suffer. There is a hard upper limit on the number of threads that can be defined. Currently, this limit is set to 32.
`timeout`, action, imdtls, word, 1800, no, , 8.2402.0, , Specifies the DTLS session timeout. As DTLS runs on transportless UDP protocol, there are no automatic detections of a session timeout.

`TimeRequery`, module, imudp, integer, 2, no, `$UDPServerTimeRequery`, , , This is a performance optimization. Getting the system time is very costly. With this setting, imudp can be instructed to obtain the precise time only once every n-times. This logic is only activated if messages come in at a very fast rate, so doing less frequent time calls should usually be acceptable. The default value is two, because we have seen that even without optimization the kernel often returns twice the identical time. You can set this value as high as you like, but do so at your own risk. The higher the value, the less precise the timestamp.
