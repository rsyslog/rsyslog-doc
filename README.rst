Rsyslog-doc
===========
This is the documentation for `rsyslog <http://www.rsyslog.com>`_ project. Source is located on `github <https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog>`_.

Rsyslog documentation is done using `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ and 
built with `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/contents.html>`_ to be published as HTML 
in `rsyslog.com <http://www.rsyslog.com/doc/master/>`_.

Please, consider this is an active development project, so although we try, documentation may not be totally up to date.

**Feel free to report any issue to help us fix it and improve it.**

How can you contribute?
-----------------------
Helping with docs is always welcome, but probably some Rsyslog knowledge will come handy.

We suggest you having a look at :doc:`Rsyslog overview <source/overview>` and asking in our `mail list <http://lists.adiscon.net/mailman/listinfo/rsyslog>`_.

Before starting, please read :doc:`source/contributing`.

Thanks, welcome and good luck!
